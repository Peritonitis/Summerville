        <p class="desc">Gifted with the power of metamorphosis,uhh nguyen is capable of
            commiting to bestial transformations in a short ammount of time to fight his foes.
            One Transformation at a time suited best for each scenario and each fight. Sworn 
            enemy of the goblin, Dr.Cemesa will do whatever it takes to stop his foes from 
            terrorizing the commonwealth, regardless if it costed him his own life, as it did.
            in his last battle, Prince died in an attemt to seal black goblin forever, unfortunately,
            all his best effor could do is buy humanity 900  years of peace before faggot goblin would
            free himself from his immortal shackles and wake from his slumber.<br>who is going
            to defend humanity against this old foe once defeated? What is humanity going to do with
            one of it's strongest heroes gone?
