        <p class="desc">Zac a.k.a Four Fifths Lean a.k.a Diabolically possessed demonic
            creature with diabolically wretched schemes for a satanically brutal ritual with the objective
            to eliminate all evil from the world, not knowing that there was no such thing as good and evil.
            <br>until he realized, that good and evil are mere concepts created by society, vowing that way
            to protect the concept of good that we all held dear.<br>
            Becoming, that way, a dancer of capoeira, destroying his enemies on the dance floor with minimal
            effort, which, didn't come without several years of arduous training and discipline, this way, Zackster
            became the first and only superhero to quite literally break his ass for justice.<br>
            Now holds a secret identity as a british rapper who is known by the name of 21 savage, with hits such as
            pussy, and many other, collaborating with other artists, such as, drake, and many others. Zackawajiyah nguyen is
            the only known hero to have held his own against the likes of kamster and his evil army of weebs and jiggaboos.
            earning this way titles such as four fifths lean, justice's broken ass(literally) and the gayest straight man
